# SmartCar
Smart car android application allows to communicate with HC-05 Bluetooth module. HC-05 is specifically being mentioned but it should work with all similar modules including HC-06 etc. 

Currently a single ASCII character is sent to bluetooth module.

Will keep updating in coming days with wiring, component configuration and code.
